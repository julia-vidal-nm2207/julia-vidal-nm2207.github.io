<p>This graph shows the completed level of education of the participants. Clearly, the large majority (94 participants, which consists of 70% of the sample) had only completed their high school education. This makes sense based on the fact that the participants were recruited via an online questionnaire distributed in univerity group chats and social media channels.</p>
