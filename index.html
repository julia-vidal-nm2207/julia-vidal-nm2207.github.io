          <h1>Online Behavioral Targeting, the Data Story</h1>
          <h2>By Julia Fernandes Vidal</h2>
          <h3>The Introduction</h3>
          <br>
          <h3>What is OBT?</h3>
          <p>Online Behavioral Targeting has completely revolutionalized modern marketing. With it, organizations can optimize their targeting strategies by tracking users online behavior and, with the data gathered, provide them with highly relevant and personalized content. However, with broad access to usersâ€™ private data, OBT can also pose serious threats, such as the exploitations of vulnerabilities and privacy concerns.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
          <h4>The Information Asymmetry</h4>
          <p>Such unintended effects of OBT become especially salient when users are not aware of how their data is being used. Of course, this knowledge is almost impossible to have in the fist place as very few transparency mechanisms are currently in place. This lack of knowledge creates a large power imbalance, where large multinationals have all the cards, and users have little to no knowledge on how this data can, and will, be used agaisnt them. In fact, users are so oblivious to OBT workings that they often cannot distinguish when they have (even if unintentionally) provided the algorithm with information or when it is so attuned to their inner thoughts that it can actually accurately predict a hidden interest. With this, users even come up with theories and folk stories that 'apps eavesdrop on their conversations'.</p>
          <h4>Echo Chambers & Polarization</h4>
          <p>This information asymmetry is a lot more harmful than it might look at first glance, as algorithms (and the companies running them) have, with access to all this private data, the power to filter what we see and what we do not see. To keep users online the longest (so more information can tracked, processes, and consequently, sold), algorithms prioritize engagement over accuracy when tagreting content, which increases the likelihood of the spread of misinformation and clickbaits. With this, different users not only see different things, but see more and more of the same, creating an echo chamber effect. With this, we see a society that is increasingly misinformed and polarized, unable to agree on things as we are not even exposed to the same truth.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>The study</h3>
          <p>This experiment was conduced by me, Julia, as part of my bachelor thesis for the University of Amsterdam in 2022. In it, I investigated the effect that transparency mechanisms have on how user's feel towards the OBT process. This Data Story will walk you through the main findings.</p>

          <h1>The Main Effect</h1>
          <h2>Do transparency mechanisms influence users' attitude towards OBT?</h2>
          <h3>The Treatment</h3>
          <p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a) experimental or (b) control. The experimental group had to press a link that took them to their own personal Google page where all their personality and behavioral attributes (as identitified by Goiogle) were listed. They were asked to explore the page and return to the questionnaire once they were done. On the other hand, the control group was given a different but comparable link, one to their Google storage manager, and asked to follow the same instructions. Users' attitudes were then measured. </p>
          <h3>Measuring Attitude towards OBT</h3>
          <p>Attitude towards OBT was measured using two indicators: (a) willingness to share data and (b) trust towards OBT. Willingness to share data measured how willing users were to actually share their personal data in order to use free web services. Trust in OBT measured how much users believed their data was kept safe in this transaction.</p>

          <h2>What role does perceived control play in this?</h2>

          <h3>What do you mean by perceived control?</h3>
          <p>Perceived Control wasa variable with the focus the perceived sense of control that being exposed to the online tracking profile might give to respondents in the experimental condition. By having access to this profile, users might feel like they have a little more control over their own data, and this can potentially change ho they feel about OBT (their attitude, namely the willingness they feel to share their data with third companies and their trust in this process). </p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <h2>& Recommendations</h2>

          <h3>What can we take from this?</h3>
          <p> The study shows that having such transparency mechansims, like the Google Profile, provides users with a perception of control over their own private data. However, due to little knowledge on the topic, this data is interpreted as overwhelming and scary (as often, users see that Google knows a lot more about them than they thought). This in turn leads to less willingness to share data. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For transparency mechanisms to indeed give some power to the users and increase their attitudes towards the process of Online Behavioral Targeting, users must be more well educated about how this data is gathered, why it is so accurate and how it is used. Seeing it is there in the profile is not enough - a more comprehensive understanding of how it is used is necessary for users to feel comfortable in being part of this business deal, giving them the full picture of what they are being a part of. 
            <br>
            <br>
Although transparency mechanisms are a start and should be insresingly implemented, education and awareness about the process of OBT must happen simultaenously for such mechanisms to truly have a positive effect on attitude towards Online Behavioral Targeting.</p>
