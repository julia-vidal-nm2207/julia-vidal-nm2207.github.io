  <p>Here, the graph is showing us that exposure to profile leads to an increased level of perceived control, which in turn leads to a decrease in willingness to share data. The more control over their data that people feel they have, the less they want to share it with this system. Likewise, when we take perceived control as a mediator, exposure to the profile also leads to a decreased level of willingness to share data. This was not the case in the main effect. Therefore, when perceived control is in the picture, it changes the effect that exposure to profile has on willinginess, turning it from a positive to a negative one.</p>
