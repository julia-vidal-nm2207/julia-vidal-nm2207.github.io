    <td>Online Behavioral Targeting is the process of tracking, processing, and selling user’s data, gathered through their online behavior, for the creation of targeted personalized content. This process is becoming increasingly popular as it allows for companies to target users with highly relevant and personalized content, optimizing marketing techniques by reaching those who are more likely to being persuaded. </td>
    <td>To analyze the data gathered, SPSS was used. A two-way ANOVA was conducted to test the main effect between Profile Exposure and Attitude towards OBT. Furthermore, PROCESS was used to test for the mediation effect of Perceived Control.</td>
    <td>Based on the findings, transparency mechanisms are indeed needed if we want users to have a more positive attitude towards OBT. However, their existance alone is not enough. The mediation effect of Perceived Control shows us that the mere presence and exposure to the profile is overwhelming to the users, which in turn decreases Willingness to Share Data. To avoid this, we must invest in education and awareness of OBT, so that users can digest and interpret the information give to them in these profiles.</td>

    <td>All the data is from my own Bachelor Thesis that I wrote for the University of Amsterdam in 2022. I gatherd my own data for this experiment by recruiting to an online questionnaire. The variables I am taking into consideration for this Data Story are Exposure to Profile (IV), Attitude towards OBT, measured with two indicators: willingness to share data and trust in OBT (DV), and Perceived Control (mediator).</td>
    <td>OBT poses some threats to users, privacy concerns being one of many. This is because OBT can infer a lot more about users’ personalities than they are aware of, and can use this information to manipulate them without their awareness. Transparency mechanisms are an attempt at bringing some balance to this scale, however, few users are aware of their existance, as they do not truly understand the workings of OBT and how it can be used agaisnt them.</td>
    <td>The results reveal that Profile Exposure leads to higher Attitude Towards OBT, resulting in an increase both in Willingness to Share Data and In Trust in OBT (as compared to the control group). However, when we take the mediation effect into account, this changes. With Perceived Control in this relationship, that increases with Profile Exposure, Willingness to Share data decreases.</td>
